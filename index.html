			<i>I have completed A-levels last November. Currecntly, doing research on Universities in search of the suitable one for me and which will help me to develop a lucrative career. I want to become a Software developer and solve global crises with my knowledge.<br>I am a person who is highly interested in acquiring new skills. This led me into this course. I hope I'll learn Web design and decvelopment properly and make good use of it. In my free time I mostly watch Japanese animated series. Those series are not only entertaining, but also increase my creativity and give me a new prospective of the world around us.</i>
